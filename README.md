I am learning about machine learning with guidance from a friend in the industry. This repository contains some of the code that I've produced along the way. I am using numpy, pytorch, and JAX to try out different ways of doing things.

If you want to run this code, **start with "Download datasets.ipynb"** to download the binarized MNIST files and convert them to numpy format.
